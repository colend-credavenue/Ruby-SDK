## Integration Document  The following are the endpoints to be called during and pre/post disbursement state of a loan.  ## Authentication  Authentication details and host will be shared privately.  ## Workflow  **Create Loan** is the initial endpoint to be called to create a loan. Loan will be processed in the background and the status of loan will be provided through the configured Webhook. However, the client can also poll the server via the **Get Loan Details** endpoint to know the loan's status(**Get Loan Details** is rate throttled and polling this API will be restricted). Loan's shall be considered rejected if proper response is not available within 10minutes.  All other endpoints are self-explanatory and can be retried upto 3 times before marking as failure.  ## Allowed Links  All Link attributes should contain 1.
