#Allcloud (Allcloud)

## Integration Document  The following are the endpoints to be called during and pre/post disbursement state of a loan.  ## Authentication  Authentication details and host will be shared privately.  ## Workflow  **Create Loan** is the initial endpoint to be called to create a loan. Loan will be processed in the background and the status of loan will be provided through the configured Webhook. However, the client can also poll the server via the **Get Loan Details** endpoint to know the loan's status(**Get Loan Details** is rate throttled and polling this API will be restricted). Loan's shall be considered rejected if proper response is not available within 10minutes.  All other endpoints are self-explanatory and can be retried upto 3 times before marking as failure.  ## Allowed Links  All Link attributes should contain 1. Accessible File Link URL which can be Public/Expiry URL/Whitelisted File Server Link(Write to tech.colending@credavenue.com for obtaining our IP address to whitelist) 2. File Link URL with Header Authentication (Header values should be shared with tech.colending@credavenue.com)  ## Allowed Fields Length <table border=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" rules=\"groups\" frame=\"hsides\">  <colgroup>  <col  class=\"org-left\" />  <col  class=\"org-left\" />  </colgroup> <thead> <tr> <th scope=\"col\" class=\"org-left\">Data Type</th> <th scope=\"col\" class=\"org-left\">Max Length</th> </tr> </thead>  <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"org-left\">String</td> <td class=\"org-left\">65,535 bytes</td> </tr>  <tr> <td class=\"org-left\">Float</td> <td class=\"org-left\">8 bytes</td> </tr>  <tr> <td class=\"org-left\">Integer</td> <td class=\"org-left\">4 bytes</td> </tr>  <tr> <td class=\"org-left\">Date</td> <td class=\"org-left\">10 characters</td> </tr>  </tbody> </table>  # Webhooks  Webhooks can be configured for the below events  1. Loan status change      Response Payload :      {         \"product_id\": \"\",         \"client_loan_id\": \"\",         \"principal_amount\": \"\",         \"interest_rate\": \"\",         \"tenure\": \"\",         \"tenure_frequency\": \"MONTHLY\",         \"cibil_score\": \"\",         \"purpose\": \"\",         \"repayment_frequency\":\"\",         \"number_of_repayments\": \"\",         \"status\": \"\",         \"principal_outstanding\": \"\",         \"reject_reason\": \"\"     }          Statuses : ['new', 'approved', 'rejected', 'agreement_signed', 'dropped', 'disbursement_ready', 'disbursed', 'matured', 'partner_settled']     2.

# load the gem
require 'credavenue_colending'

# The following  was generated by the `rspec --init` command. Conventionally, all
# specs live under a `spec` directory, which RSpec adds to the `$LOAD_PATH`.
# The generated `.rspec` file contains `--require spec_helper` which will cause
# this file to always be loaded, without a need to explicitly require it in any
# files.
#
# Given that it is always loaded, you are encouraged to keep this file as
# light-weight as possible. Requiring heavyweight dependencies from this file
# will add to the boot time of your test suite on EVERY test run, even for an
# individual file that may not need all of that loaded. Instead, consider making
# a separate helper file that requires the additional dependencies and performs
# the additional setup, and require it from the spec files that actually need
# it.
#
# The `.rspec` file also contains a few flags that are not defaults but that
# users commonly want.
#
# See http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-core/RSpec/Core/Configuration

    # This option will default to `true` in RSpec 4. It makes the `description`
    # and `failure_message` of custom matchers include text for helper methods
    # defined using `chain`, e.g.:
    #     be_bigger_than(2).and_smaller_than(4).description
    #     # => "be bigger than 2 and smaller than 4"
    # ...rather than:
    #     # => "be bigger than 2"

  # library (such as bogus or mocha) by changing the `mock_with` option here.
  config.mock_with :rspec do |mocks|
